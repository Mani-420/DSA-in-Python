# O(1) constant time ----------------------------------------
# This only takes 3 steps 
# Random access in an array
# Inserting element at the beginning of linkedlist



# O(log n) Logarithmic Time ----------------------------------------
# Binary search 
# Slow at the start but then remains almost constant. As the data increases it takes time but then time gets constant.



# O(n) Linear Time ----------------------------------------
# Linear Access
# Searching through a linkedlist
# Looping through elements in an array
# This will take more steps as the data grows more. It gets slower as the data increases.



# O(n log n) Quasilinear Time ----------------------------------------
# Quick sort
# Merge sort
# Heap sort
# Very Slow. As the data increases it takes more and more time.



# O(n^2) Quadratic Time ----------------------------------------
# Insertion sort
# Selection sort
# Bubble sort
# Too Slow. Even with less data takes too much time.



# O(n!) Factorial Time ----------------------------------------
# Traveling Salesman Problem
# Extremly Slow. Even with less data takes extremly large time.
